Accessful - Accessible Travel Directory
Accessful is a comprehensive platform dedicated to helping travelers with mobility, visual, or other physical challenges find truly accessible accommodations, restaurants, and attractions worldwide.

Problem We Solve
Traditional travel platforms like Google offer vague "accessible" filters that don't provide the detailed information needed by people with specific accessibility requirements. A simple "step-free path" designation doesn't guarantee a roll-in shower or adequate space for mobility devices.

Detailed accessibility filters (roll-in shower width, bed height, door widths, etc.)
